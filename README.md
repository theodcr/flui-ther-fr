flui-ther-fr
============

French fluid mechanics and thermics course, targeted at engineering students.

Most chapters are still under development. Especially a lot to do on chapters *Thermodynamique*, *Rh√©ologie* and *Ecoulements compressibles*.

Compilation
-----------

The pdf version of the course can be built using the Makefile, which calls latexmk. This project should compile with any recent Latex editor using pdflatex.
